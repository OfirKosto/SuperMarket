In order to use the system for the first time without knowing the staff ids I made an admin manager for the system.

All you need to do is run the program, click Manager and then write "admin" in the id box, after that you can know all the staff ids and even creat new ones.

Another thing you need to know is if you want to change/order somting from the tables you have to click it in the table and then select the option you want.
